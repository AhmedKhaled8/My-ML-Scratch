# My-ML-Scratch
This repository contains some notebook in which I try to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch. The repository contains the followin (unchecked items will be added later. Some of the checked items can be enhanced later.

- [x]  Plotting (TODO: Adding `seaborn` quick tutorial)
- [x]  Preprocessing (TODO: Adding some feature engineering)
- [x]  Simple Linear Regression
- [x]  Multivariate Linear Regression
- [x]  Logistic Regression (TODO: Add some hyperparameter tuning of the `sklearn` class from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tODN7x3BO_E) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pooXM9mM7FU)) (TODO: Add multi-class classification using the softmax function)
- [ ]  Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net
- [ ]  Na√Øve-Bayes Classifier
- [ ]  KNN
- [ ]  K-Means (K-Modes/K-Prototypes)
- [ ]  SVM
- [ ]  Decision Tree
- [ ]  Random Forrest
- [ ]  Dimensionality Reduction
- [ ]  Gradient Boosting
