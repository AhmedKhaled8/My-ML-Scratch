# My-ML-Scratch
This repository contains some notebook in which I try to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch. The repository contains the followin (unchecked items will be added later. Some of the checked items can be enhanced later.)

- [x]  Visualization
- [x]  Preprocessing (TODO: Adding some feature engineering)
- [x]  Simple Linear Regression
- [x]  Multivariate Linear Regression
- [x]  Logistic Regression (TODO: Add some hyperparameter tuning of the `sklearn` class from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tODN7x3BO_E) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pooXM9mM7FU)) (TODO: Add multi-class classification using the softmax function)
- [x]  Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- [ ]  Decision Tree
- [ ]  KNN
- [ ]  K-Means
- [ ]  Neural Network
